              It's not always easy to follow up an album with such HUGE success as Ed's "X" was. So I must say I was pleasantly surprised to receive and listen to my copy of "Divide" and realize just how strong of an album it is. In my opinion I believe it is his best album yet - and that's saying A LOT! The one thing I love about Divide is Ed manages to provide EVERY type of music he makes into his albums - be it pop, rap, up-tempo, very slow ballad, Irish folk, etc. His "sound" is so many different sounds.
              One of my favorites is Dive, a slower melodic song with a great guitar rhythm and strong vocals. But maybe I'm just a sucker for heart tugging songs, because Supermarket Flowers, a song about his Mum(grandmother) will possibly bring tears to your eyes. It is a great example of an album with a lot of maturity and continues Ed's willingness to open his heart and soul to his fans.

                  This is the third in a line of incredible musical releases that follow the naming pattern that he started with his first solo release - PLUS (+) and then the sophomore album of MULTIPLY (X). I once again purchased this on vinyl and get the digital download!
                  We all got a taste of this album with the early release of a couple of songs that made their way to the top of the radio playlist. "Shape of You" let us know that Ed was following in the path of his previously release music with a familiar sound and artistry that we have come to know and love. The backing tracks of an upbeat soulful up tempo song that paints the images in your head of the girl that physically pushes all the right buttons. There is no denying his style of writing and where you go when you listen.
